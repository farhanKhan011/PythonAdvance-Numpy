# -------------------------NumPy Splitting Array---------------------------

Splitting NumPy Arrays
Splitting is reverse operation of Joining.
Joining merges multiple arrays into one and Splitting breaks one array into multiple.
We use array_split() for splitting arrays, we pass it the array we want to split and the number of splits.
Example:
Split the array in 3 parts:
'''
# import numpy as np
# arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
# newArr = np.array_split(arr,3)
# print(newArr)
# Note: The return value is a list containing three arrays.

# If the array has less elements than required, it will adjust from the end accordingly.

'''
Split the array in 4 parts:
'''
# import numpy as np
# arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
# newArr = np.array_split(arr,4)
# print(newArr)
# Note: We also have the method split() available but it will not adjust the elements when elements are less in source array for splitting like in example above, array_split() worked properly but split() would fail.

'''
Split Into Arrays
The return value of the array_split() method is a list containing each of the split as an array.
If you split an array into 3 arrays, you can access them from the result just like any array element:
Example
Access the splitted arrays:
'''
# import numpy as np
# arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
# newArr = np.array_split(arr,3)
# print(newArr[0])
# print(newArr[1])
# print(newArr[2])

'''
Splitting 2-D Arrays
Use the same syntax when splitting 2-D arrays.
Use the array_split() method, pass in the array you want to split and the number of splits you want to do.
Example
Split the 2-D array into three 2-D arrays.
'''
# import numpy as np
# arr = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]])
# newArr = np.array_split(arr,3)
# print(newArr[0])
# print(newArr[1])
# print(newArr[2])
'''
The example above returns three 2-D arrays.
Let's look at another example, this time each element in the 2-D arrays contains 3 elements.
Example
Split the 2-D array into three 2-D arrays.
'''
# import numpy as np
# arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18]])
# newArr = np.array_split(arr,3)
# print(newArr)

'''
The example above returns three 2-D arrays.
In addition, you can specify which axis you want to do the split around.
The example below also returns three 2-D arrays, but they are split along the column (axis=1).
Example
Split the 2-D array into three 2-D arrays along columns.
'''
# import numpy as np
# arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18]])
# newarr = np.array_split(arr, 3, axis=1)
# print(newarr)

'''
An alternate solution is using hsplit() opposite of hstack()
Example
Use the hsplit() method to split the 2-D array into three 2-D arrays along columns.
'''
# import numpy as np
# arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18]])
# newarr = np.hsplit(arr, 3)
# print(newarr)
# Note: Similar alternates to vstack() and dstack() are available as vsplit() and dsplit().
